# Dubstep Visualizer
Created a Audio Visualizer in JavaScript. This has the ability to dynamically change colors, shape, frequencies, and distort music using delay/analyzer nodes. The user has the ability to customize tracks, the canvas API (waveform or frequency), display options, display modes, color sliders, curve effects, and default effects.

The user is able to choose form 3 songs, Breaking up my Bones by Vinyl Theatre, Running Out by Astrid S & Matoma, and Tongues by Joywave. The canvas API is able to create lines, Bezier and cubic curves, circles, rectangles, and a gradient.  I used various context state variables to do this such as adding rgba values with a makecolor function and individually adding rgba values, fillstyles and strokestyles.

No jQuery was used, no JS libraries, used “use strict”;, and used no global variables. For the course I was taking we had to separate functions, follow appropriate naming conventions. Commented each function explaining what it does as well as essential commands including for loops and specific effects.
